# rxsPrivEsc
Basic script of linux commands useful for initial enumeration of a target machine when looking for privilige escalation vectors.  Initially created when studying for the OSCP

By default the script pauses after each command so you can actually look at the output and have a think about it.  Supply any arg to the script and it will just run straight through
